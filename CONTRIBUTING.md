## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

**Required Tools:**
- [Terraform](https://terraform.io) >= 1.0
- [Docker](https://docker.com) & Docker Compose
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Bash shell (Linux/macOS/WSL)

**Recommended Tools:**
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with extensions:
  - Terraform
  - Docker
  - ShellCheck
  - YAML
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for automated checks

### Local Development Environment

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sivolko/aws-soc-lab-wazuh.git
   cd aws-soc-lab-wazuh
   
   # Install pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)
   pre-commit install
   ```

2. **Configure Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Copy example configuration
   cp terraform/terraform.tfvars.example terraform/terraform.tfvars.dev
   
   # Edit with your development settings
   vim terraform/terraform.tfvars.dev
   ```

3. **Validate Changes**
   ```bash
   # Terraform validation
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   terraform validate
   terraform fmt -check
   
   # Docker validation
   cd ../docker
   docker-compose config
   
   # Script validation
   find scripts/ -name "*.sh" -exec shellcheck {} \;
   ```

### Testing Guidelines

**Infrastructure Testing:**
```bash
# Plan deployment without applying
terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars.dev"

# Use terraform-compliance for policy testing (optional)
pip install terraform-compliance
terraform-compliance -f tests/ -p plans/
```

**Script Testing:**
```bash
# Use shellcheck for shell script linting
shellcheck scripts/**/*.sh

# Test script execution with dry-run flags where available
./scripts/deployment/deploy-full-lab.sh --dry-run
```

**Documentation Testing:**
```bash
# Check markdown links
npm install -g markdown-link-checkind . -name "*.md" -exec markdown-link-check {} \;

# Spell check (optional)
npm install -g cspell
cspell "**/*.md"
```
